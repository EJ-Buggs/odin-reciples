        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. 
            Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle 
            and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix 
            until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>

            <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean 
            work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, 
            smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>

            <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, 
            turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at 
            least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li>

            <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. 
            Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape 
            into balls.</li>

            <li>Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes 
            to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). 
            Place a pizza stone or heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat) 
            to the oven.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree 
            with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor and puree 
            until smooth.</li>

            <li>Once the dough has rested, take one portion and start by poking the dough with 
            your fingertips. Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin crust. Make it 
            thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up 
            during baking!</li>

            <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an inverted baking sheet and place your stretched crust onto 
            it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your preference.</li>

            <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until the crust and cheese looks golden brown.</li>
            
            <li>Add any garnish of your preferences and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
